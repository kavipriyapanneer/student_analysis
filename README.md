### Project Overview

**Project Title:** Student Details Dashboard of an Institution

**Description:** 
This project is a data visualization dashboard developed using Power BI to represent the key metrics and insights of student course completions in an educational institution. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the courses completed by students, the associated fees, and other critical statistics over the years.

**Key Features:**
- **Course Completion Count:** Displays the total number of course completions by students.
- **Sum of Fees:** Represents the total revenue generated from course fees.
- **Course Completion by Month:** A line chart visualizing the monthly course completions, allowing users to identify trends and seasonal patterns.
- **Year-Wise Course Completion:** A bar chart that breaks down course completions by year, offering a historical perspective.
- **Course Price Details:** A table showing the minimum fees for various courses offered, providing insight into the cost structure.
- **Course Completion Distribution:** A pie chart representing the percentage distribution of students who completed each course, helping to understand the popularity of each course.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Data Sources:** The data was sourced from the institution's database containing student records, course details, and fee structures.

**Usage:**
This dashboard is intended for use by educational institutions to monitor and analyze student progress, course popularity, and financial performance. It enables stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time data insights.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Integration with real-time data updates.
- Adding predictive analytics to forecast future trends in course completion.
- Enhancing interactivity with drill-down features for more granular insights.

**How to Run:**
1. Open the Power BI file with the dashboard.
